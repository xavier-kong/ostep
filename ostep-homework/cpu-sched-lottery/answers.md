### Question 1

### Question 2
Probability of job 0 ever getting the winning ticket is so low that it doesn't run until job 1 is finished

### Question 3
Equal ticket allocation seems to make the scheduler more fair, with different seeds the fairness is more or less the same

### Question 4
Fairness decreases with increase in quantum size, probably because larger quantum sizes reduces the number of times the lottery is run so less chances for differences to be "smoothed out".

### Question 5
With a stride scheduler the fairness should be constant if both jobs are of the same runtime.
